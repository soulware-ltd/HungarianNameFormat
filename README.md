Changes first and last name in EditViews
===

In SugarCRM names on forms appear in fixed order despite the display format preference. The salutation appears with the last name as a customCode in the metadata file. This simple plugin switches the first and last name.

The following metadata files are involved:
-Contacts/editviewdefs.php
-Contacts/quickcreatedefs.php
-Leads/editviewdefs.php
-Leads/quickcreatedefs.php
-Leads/convertdefs.php
-Prospects/editviewdefs.php
-Prospects/quickcreatedefs.php
